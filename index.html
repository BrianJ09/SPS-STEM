                    <p>
                        In the theory, we were nervous at first, but we gained some hope after the paper. Overall, a fun experience for both theory and practical

                    <p>
                        I struggled in the theory component, but managed to squeeze my thinking and presentation skills during the practical component. I am sure I managed to takeaway some key learning points from this competition like working in a team and staying calm when a challenge arises.

                        I think this challenge was one very fun activity, allowing us to learn various things along the way. The practical was the highlight, allowing us to showcase our creations. Overall, it taught us a lot about working together as a team and perserverance.

                    <p>
                        I think this championship is one that has been an unexpectedly fun activity to take part in. I feel it really stretches your brain for its thinking process and makes you realize how many ideas we can possibly come up with. This experience was one where I wish we got a second chance but regardless this will be one unforgettable experience.
